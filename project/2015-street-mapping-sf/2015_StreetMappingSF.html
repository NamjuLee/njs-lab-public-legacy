        <h4>Since 1769, San Francisco has been one of the
          most significant cities in the United State of America.<br>
          During the Gold Rush period, it was the attractor for many
          people who were in the pursuit of new economic wealth.<br>
          In addition the city of San Francisco had a significant
          role during the World War II. Now, as a global city, San<br>
          Francisco generates new types of effects on the qualities
          of our economic and living conditions by supporting global<br>
          companies such Information technology enterprise, such
          as Google, Twitter, Facebook and so on. Apart from its<br>
          historical significance, nowadays, San Francisco stands as
          an important touristic attractor. Thus, San Francisco can be<br>
          considered as a single active living organism that functions
          as an aggregation of people’s individual intelligence.<br>
          Intelligence is addressed as an accumulation of
          experiences regarding places (secret spots), preferences<br>
          (historical place to buy Ukulele in SF), interests etc. In this
          context, my interest lies in revealing the “third place” as<br>
          a space that encourages people to share their individual
          intelligence and perception of the city. In order to reveal<br>
          the third place, I consider the understanding of homeless
          people’s life important, since it differs substantially from<br>
          the life of an average person. Homeless people utilize
          urban environment at the same time as their house, their<br>
          workplace, their sleeping place etc.<br>
          <br>
          During my research on the homeless population
          in San Francisco, I recognized different types of homeless<br>
          people, based on their way of living. Among those
          different types, I wish to focus on those who tend to<br>
          form a daily routine, for instance, the ones that have
          developed particular skills based on their interest (musical<br>
          instruments, crafting etc.), or the ones that belong
          to certain groups etc. I consider these groups not as<br>
          deprived groups, but as memory of the city, because
          they have developed methods to take advantage of the<br>
          urban environment in an intelligent way that is not easy to
          perceive otherwise. The before mentioned, motivates me<br>
          to reveal and visualize space as a third place, as the place
          between home and workspace, where people can relax<br>
          and share their interests.<br>
          <br>

During my research, data can
be considered as a tool for visualizing 
the patterns of similarity and difference
<br>
network based on people’s interest. Data makes it possible both to
perceive and understand the third data<br>
that control different perspectives in an
indirect way. I believe that visualization, as an instrument for communicating
ideas, <br>
can shift our way of thinking and behaving. For example, if the
energy consumption of a house could<br>
be visualized as disproportionate
to its size, people would be able to perceive their energy consumption
based on <br>
the size of their houses. If their house shrinks, this means that
the consumption of energy is too high.<br>
Iin the same context, visualization of
trash tracing or sharing a taxi in NYC done by “SENSEable City Lab” can
be <br>
considered as examples for raising people’s awareness. Data visualization
can be considered as a positive<br>
motivation for people to rethink their
living condition and urban environment and not as something <br>
that urges
people to shift their way of thinking entirely.<br>
<br>
What if we visualize the
human experience regarding urban condition in a tangible way? What
if such individual small intelligence<br>
can be transformed into a swarm of
aggregated intelligence in the urban context? Although there are tons of
places <br>
where people can state and communicate their opinions and ideas
in the virtual world, in reality, people<br>
tend to disregard the potentiality
of space to operate as a collective platform of sharing interests, by
repeating the same routine <br>
between home and workspace. So, what if I
am able to reveal a space in the city, where people can participate <br>
in as a
third place, that can also be considered as a gateway between the real and
the virtual world? Termite taxonomies<br>
provide a good example for addressing
collective intelligence. Termites’ individual intelligence is insignificant,
<br>
but when populated, they construct 30-meter-diameter mounds. I wish
to learn how to reveal possible third<br>
place’s pattern and how to generate
collaborative urban intelligence, based on data visualization as the main
research tool.<br>
