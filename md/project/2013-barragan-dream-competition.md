**Our Homage**    

In 1964, Luis Barragan published an astonishing design for the city of Lomas Verdes located on the outskirt of Mexico City, but the project was not realized as he dreamed. In Archivo’s garden next to his former studio, we propose to create its homage.

It is a model in a shape of scaled fragments of his unrealized design, and digital visualization of the entire un-built city is superimposed over the model on tablet computers driven by Augmented Reality technology. A visitor to Archivo’s garden will experience Barragan’s dream city by walking directly on this scale model as well as by looking at additional virtual buildings and details through the hand-held device.

At the same time, fabrics of the scale model of the city serves as benches for events and beverage kiosk of Archivo’s café.
