## A PHENOMENON [Uncertain Surface Series Work] 2010


Since 2010 

This series of works are experimental simulations regarding a surface or a mass defined by certain phenomena or environments. At first, each project concentrates on a passive surface and mass made by external conditions rather than an artificial surface or mass. Also, this intangible simulation is finally converted to mass or surface sequences as time passes.
