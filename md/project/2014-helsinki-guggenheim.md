Based on the rich cultural and geographical context of the site, the project strives to answer the following question throughout the design process: “How can the Helsinki Guggenheim Museum physically and symbolically expand its cultural presence beyond the boundary of the building itself towards the city and public realm?” In response to this key question this proposal initiates from a broader urban framework rather than from the museum configuration.

The unique urban context of the site demands a set of calibrated responses to integrate both the waterfront and the cityscape. As part of the Eteläsatama (South Harbor) waterfront development and adjacent to the Olympia Terminal, the site acts as the urban node between a maritime, pedestrian and public transportation axis. Situated between the seaport and park, the proposed museum frames the views toward the major city landmarks and key public spaces. The project is carefully integrated with the existing urban fabric and strengthens the identity of the vibrant cityscape of Helsinki. In order to create a timeless yet active cultural civic space, two core concepts are implemented: To question the privacy and enclosure of a typical museum by proposing a public park knotted around the exhibition space; and a building composition that withstands and takes advantage of the local climate conditions for an optimal sustainable approach.
