Relationship among data in a space

Discrete a space into parts

1. Graph

Graph is a mathematical object that consists of set of points and edges, dealing with discrete information.

Graph is widely used for computation, discrete mathematics or representing relational data structures, and It has explicit relationship among vertices by edges visualizing the topological aspect such as street network of urban, highway or the subway map, whose graphs closely resemble their physical form due to its characteristics.


2. Pixel / Voxel (Volumetric Element)

- Voxel could be considered as a set of image(pixel)

Voxel is a 3 dimensional grid containing pixels can have rich data set including R, G, B, A values. It is frequently utilized for visualization of scientific or medical data which is needed for volumetric representation.

Voxel for geometry in space is a discretized space of geometry where it has a beam or node are connecting but as a continuous map in space. This is basically an idea that an object become a 3 dimensional map.
