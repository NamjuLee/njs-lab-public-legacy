Gosan-dong, as a modern neighborhood, is the consequence of a recent rapid urban development.

Similar to other “new town” developments in Korea and throughout Asia, it, too, has the inherent discontinuity of the sense of community and loci between the past and the present. Our proposal attempts to mitigate this by creating a community library that respects the present context and usage of the site and setting a concrete foundation for the neighborhood's future development. The current site was developed as a community park and children’s playground.
