SHORT DESCRIPTION:
This course investigates diverse quantitative methods to measure and analyze emerging urban spatial issues of COVID-19 relevant to contemporary urban planning and design practice. The course is based on spatial network analytics approaches that aim to offer students learning tools (Rhino GH and Python) and understanding the data and the process for integrating pedestrian flow information and decision making with urban planning and design solutions. It structures into four experiments:

Pedestrian flows by the shortest path
Pedestrian route choice analysis: how far people are willing to walk
Pedestrian route choice analysis: attractiveness vs. deviation
Spatial activity patterns, indoor & outdoor: safe distance of 6ft (2m)
LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
After the lectures and workshop, students can do:

Computational design concept and language for basics
Use network analysis techniques for pedestrian flows, route choice, location accessibility, mapping, and data visualization
Apply these techniques into practices in architecture, urban planning, design, and policy.
KEY WORDS:
6ft, Daily Routine, Urban Mobility, Urban Design Quality, Walkability, COVID-19, Urbanism, Computational Geometry, Visualization, Urban and Architectural Data, …

TIMEZONE:
First Week
KST, 11 AM - 3 PM, 18(Tue) Aug, 2020
KST, 11 AM — 3 PM, 20(Thu) Aug, 2020

Second Week
KST, 9AM — 10AM, 24(Tue) — 28(Fri) Aug, 2020

PREREQUISITES:
We use multiple programs, including Rhino 3D (GH and Python), along with new experimental exercises. If you enjoy exploring quantitative analysis, this is the right course for you. After the workshop, you might discover a whole new view for urban planning, design, and built environments.
