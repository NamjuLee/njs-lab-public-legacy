Manufactured landscape from recycled materials
 
The fundamental approach for designing ‘STACKed’ began with acknowledging the integral relationship between the installation site and the overall Radcliff Institute site. Radcliff Yard is defined by a ring of buildings (solid) and the space between them (voids) that surrounds the perimeter of the yard. Although the existing empty installation lot acts as a void in this context, this relationship can either be maintained or converted depending on the nature of the installation. From this recognition, we have decided to transform the site into a solid (object) in order to further enhance the boundary condition of the Radcliff Yard.

In order to strategically address the multi-directional nature of the site as well as its relationship with the yard, the overall geometry of STACKed is derived from the site itself. Guidelines, circles and axes that influence the overall form of the installation were generated using the center point of the Radcliff Yard as well as critical viewpoints from the adjacent roads. From the overall spherical massing of STACKed, two sweeping geometries are carved out in order to create two zones of activity: an outdoor theater and an exhibition tunnel. Each zone of activity is further augmented using programmable lighting embedded inside the installation components that responds to the environment and people (noise and proximity).

The key material and construction strategy of the installation is simply stacking salvaged steel tubes in the previously sculpted form. Post-tensioning elements will hold the tubes and ensure the structural integrity of the installation as well eliminate the need to drill into the steel tubes themselves. This strategy will allow the installation to be dismantled and sold back to the salvage yard for re-usage.
