Street in Office can be a novel solution to reconcile the alienation between workers in an office and people on the street. Through sites selected by data-driven methodology, the Street in Office can revitalize the streets by designing the office environment through the following three points.


(1) Street is a social mixer, where the street is a changing place to interact with people. For example, take the streets of NYC, known for its rich and poor, “Street as a social mixer” would claim that all people use the street regardless of social status, enabling people to encounter others unlike them. Thus, creating interaction and essential acceptance of those who are different as a means of constructing a civil society. The street office should embed those social mixer values.


(2) Street as a depository; Street is a locale of history. We have to live with the decisions of the past on the street. Take, for instance, Rome, which created a system of streets that, to date, have instilled a sense of history for those who navigate the old roads. On the street, we can interact not only with each other but also by aggregating decisions and creating history. In this context, Street became a depository of history.


(3) Street as a social platform utilizes the street as a platform, a performance stage, and a site for the potential expression; of social, cultural, and political voices. Ex people giving a pamphlet as a social expression.


On the urban level, data-driven design methodology is utilized for data analysis and visualization of activity at an urban scale. Data in this project is crucial because it shows patterns and makes it possible to perceive and understand the third emerging condition of streets from different angles of the urban context.


The integrated data-driven mythology with GIS and Mechanical Turk can enrich the data sets and collect information about an urban environment, revealing diverse interpretations of the street’s potential uses or problems. This affects the site selections. At the architectural level, a module system, as a design agency, is shaped by parametric rule-based design to integrate a holistic design language from urban context to architectural scale. The system consists of three scales (small, middle, and large scale) that can be populated based on data from urban or local levels. Design space exploration enables the agency to optimize and generate a design with the data as a form-finding methodology and energy analysis and optimization that defines the detailing of the modules.
