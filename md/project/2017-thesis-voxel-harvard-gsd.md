### Remixing and Resampling Three Dimensional Objects Use of Volumetric Representations And Machine Learning in Design
#### Design Workflows Integrating Machine Learning and Voxel Representations


**ABSTRACT**

This thesis aims to explore the opportunities of voxel modeling with Machine Learning.
First, it introduces (1) what voxel modeling is, compared to traditional model techniques, the characteristics of voxel models such as pixel map and graph representation, and what Deep Learning and networks are. The thesis examines (2) prototypical implementations of proposed design systems or workflows based on the process from rasterization of space and geometry to Machine Learning.
