Content: An experiment on how to perceive the interaction between light and a surface

In fact, of the five senses, including sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste, humans can perceive a space and a surface mainly depending on sight. In other words, the spaces and surfaces I made for this exhibition could be expressed or materialized by light. Surfaces created by the light are stored as information in our brain consecutively, and based on that assumption; an afterimage phenomenon on our brain could generate space having time lines.
