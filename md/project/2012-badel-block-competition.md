There are several features to be preserved inside the site. 

They are the characteristics of the context around, the value of the Zagrebâ€™s block as well as to be preserved buildings. The essential feature of the Badel block is the spatial quality created from its shape and configuration and the urban connectivity with the context through the pathways. The figure-ground that generates the courtyard is the most important feature to be preserved, so enabling the connectivity throughout the figure as well as meeting the required area of the programs would be the key issue of this project.
