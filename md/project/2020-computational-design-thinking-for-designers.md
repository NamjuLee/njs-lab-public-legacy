The keywords could help designers to start thinking like a computational design specialist. Computational thinking in design asks you holistic approaches to resolve a small design problem while also asking you an extremely isolated process to fix a comprehensive design concern. These different levels of the approach become huddles to understand computational design processes for designers.

The keywords could guide you, who have no computer science backgrounds, to deal with the dilemma, and you would be able to get a sense of understanding of developing computational design process in manifold circumstances in your design practices.
