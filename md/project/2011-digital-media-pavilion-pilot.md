## Digital Media Pavilion Pilot by University of Technology, Sydney(UTS) 2011


Digital Media Pavilion Pilot by University of Technology, Sydney

Role: a researcher

The proposals for a vibrant and highly visual ‘Urban Digital Media’ pavilion, located right at the heart of UTS in the foyer of our tower

Why a pilot pavilion?

The proposal is a development of the Urban Digital Media (UDM) strategic plan. It offers a pilot project that can subsequently be developed and rolled out for other aspects of the campus - initially and specifically for the digital spaces of the Broadway building. The earlier UDM plan argued for the University to take the lead in pushing a digital campus, an idea that has yet to be embraced seriously by Universities worldwide.
