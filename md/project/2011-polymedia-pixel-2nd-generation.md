## Polymedia Pixel 2nd generation Dr Hank Haeusler, UTS [Media-architecture] 2011

Role: a researcher

The Polymedia Pixel investigates the potential for computer-augmented architectural materials to catalyze responsive and interactive communication between buildings in a precinct that relates to resource utilization information. The principal aim is to allow buildings to collect, analyze, and exchange information. The four-stage research intends to provide evidence, develop the Polymedia Pixel as a computer-augmented architectural material, deploy and evaluate the Polymedia Pixel in an architectural context, and design and curate building information content. Using a systematic prototyping and evaluation approach, the research will provide findings and applications for improved information exchange between buildings that potentially optimize resource utilization.
