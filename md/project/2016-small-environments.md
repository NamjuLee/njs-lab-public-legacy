This is an implementation of [LANDBOX algorithms](http://localhost:9999/njs-lab-public/research-project?project=2015-neu-development). It has four different game modes, 1: Tutorial mode, 2: LandBox mode, 3: Small asteroid modes, 4 Small island modes, to simulate the environmental system.

Oh, we need to protect these small environments from disasters and maintain the balance between human activity and the environment.
