## Complex Center Architectural Design 2006

How can a media center become a media object in and of itself? The building identifies nearby objects, such as humans and vehicles, as formally generative agents. The facade integrates and reacts to their complex movements.
The concept deals with two main types of movement on an urban scale. Comparably, fast and slow continuity can exist, and they have contrasting characteristics, 
 such as levels of approaches, perceptions, or interactions. Thus, cells representing spaces can be modified or created by their immediate approaching level.
