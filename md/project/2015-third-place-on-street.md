## The Third Places on the street, Satellite Office Design Research Project 2015

Conceptually, the satellite office project aims to provide people with diverse experiences on the street. Street mainly acts as pass way in urban, but it means more than just pedestrians. Individual Street has its unique history, name, and activity based on the context around the street.

Under the idea of “Office on the street,” this project tries to develop and revitalize streets as an office where productive and creative energy is created. In addition, although the number of “Third Places” is on the rise, the physical limitations of the current places still exist. To react to these problems, a movable module system is being developed. The system is designed not only for the physical environment, such as buildings, parking lots, roads, or subways, where the module is installed, but also for the historical or cultural assets.
