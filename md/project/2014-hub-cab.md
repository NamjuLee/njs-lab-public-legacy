Exploring New York City taxi trails and sharing our way to a more sustainable urban future

With an ever-increasing trove of real-time urban data streams, we are able to see precisely where, how, and at what times different parts of our cities become stitched together as hubs of mobility. By using these pervasive, interconnected, and "smart" technologies, we can begin to unravel the complexity of our travel patterns and identify how we can reduce the social and environmental costs embedded in our transportation systems. In HubCab we target taxicab services as a way to understand the linkages between our travel habits and the places we travel to and from most often.
