DigitalFUTURES WORLD : ARCHITECTS UNITE Workshops

Subtitle: Introduction to Computational Design for Geometry Visualization and Data Visualization for Digital Mapping on Web

Short Description:
This is a hands-on workshop and lecture series about the Introduction to Computational Design for Data and Geometry Visualization for Digital Mapping on Web. For those who are interested in developing both the ideas and skills of data and geometry visualization to understand the data in architectural or urban contexts, this workshop is yours. The workshop consists of three key parts: (1) processing and visualizing data (2) constructing geometries (3) developing a pipeline for an interactive mapping system. Using HTML canvas and ArcGIS JSAPI, we are going to understand the holistic process and the pipeline of data and geometry visualization and mapping. In the workshop, key coding demos and related lectures will happen, and coding exercises with the boilerplate code will be followed as homework after the workshop.
