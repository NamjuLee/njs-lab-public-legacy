[A Parasitic Urban Furniture Compiler](http://localhost:9999/njs-lab-public/research-project/?project=2015-ac-development)


**Overview**
The compiler for the parasitic urban furniture is divided into four steps. Pass A takes into account the geometric rationalization of the design. This means it takes a given mesh or surface and converts it into an unrolled two-dimensional representation. Pass B inputs joints, seams, and tabs onto the two-dimensional drawing for assembly, and Pass C nests the drawings into a boundary for fabrication. Finally, Pass D gives the instructions that aid in the assembly process.

**Methods**
Our design methodology used a parametric process to generate multiple strips that combined to form a seat that could be attached to a bus stop post. The parametric model allows us to adjust various design parameters to adjust ergonomics and functionality. The design process was then run through the compiler to develop a workable file for fabrication.

**Materialization**
The strips were fabricated from two 4’x 8’, 16 gauge steel sheets using an OMAX water jet. The steel strips were bent at specific locations using a brake machine and attached to a uni strut using standard nuts and bolts. Steel was chosen as the material of choice due to its bending qualities, which allowed for flexibility of the structure after fabrication.

**Realization**
The apparent realization is the complications that unfold once a design is taken out of the digital phase and implemented into real-life fabrication. Bending steel at the correct angles was a challenge, as well as rationalizing the assembly process in terms of nuts and bolts. A thorough research of material properties and behavior through test cuts and simulations is always advisable to grasp the possibilities and limitations of the assembly process.

**Future Work**
We intend to refine the compiler further so that the assembly can be a smoother process. The use of steel has been a challenging but fascinating experience, and we intend to explore the material and its possibilities for fabrication in the future.
