#### [_Computational Design Thinking for Designers_](https://nj-namju.medium.com/computational-design-thinking-for-designers-68224bb07f5c)
* Korean, English 
* **keywords:** Computational Design, Data, How to code for designers, Design algorithm, Computational Thinking ...  
* **These keywords** could help traditional designers to start thinking like computational design specialists. Computational thinking in design asks you holistic approaches to resolve a small design problem while also asking you an extremely isolated process to fix a comprehensive design concern. These different policies and thinking levels become huddles to understand computational design processes for designers.


#### [_Data in Design_](https://nj-namju.medium.com/data-design-c21457dc8dc)
* Korean, English
* **keywords:** Computational Design, Data, How to code for designers, Design algorithm, Computational Thinking ...  
* **Data** is becoming increasingly available for specialists and designers in diverse ways as a new material in the 21st century. Data's importance has led to the new age of design, making holistic design approaches in architectural, landscape, and urban design possible: Optimization, parametric design, data-driven design, and something fundamentally reliant on data. Therefore, the use of data in design is becoming much more significant than ever. Mainly, the change in our life by autonomous vehicles, IoT, blockchain, or smart cities based on 5G technology will accelerate the way of living and thinking, generating and consuming data every day. This lecture shows some snippets of How designers could surf with this new wave



#### [_How to code for designers_](https://computationaldesign.tistory.com/37)
* Korean, ~~English~~
* **keywords:** Computational Design, Data, How to code for designers, Design algorithm, Computational Thinking ...  
* **This lecture series** is for the freshman in architectural design school. It helps students understand and harness hardware and software technology in design process as tools, particularly how to use data as design materials and code the design process with the data as instructions.
