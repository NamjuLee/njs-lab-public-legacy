## Code for Design

#### [_Computational Design [Book]_](https://computationaldesign.tistory.com/49)
* Korean, ~~English~~
* **keywords:** Computational Design, Data, How to code for designers, Computational Design Thinking, Design Algorithm...  
* **Research** An introduction to Computational Design for designers. This Book(P394) talks about data, design, and algorithms, how designers understand the paradigm shifts(with the 4th industrial revolution), and how to prepare for them. This book helps novice designers to start becoming computational designers. English version of it has been writing now.

#### [_HTML Canvas Optimization of Rendering Loop_](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/html-canvas-optimization-of-rendering-loop-with-jsapi-for-drawing-on-map-71cb0500a213)
* ~~Korean~~, English
* **keywords:** Data visualization, Real-time Graphics, Pipeline, HTML Canvas, Mapping ...  
* **This article** talks about a technical solution for a real-time rendering loop with HTML Canvas API for digital mapping or data visualization and how to set up and optimize the rendering pipeline based on a web-based visualization app.



#### [_Clustering Points: Collision-Based Dynamic Grid Graph method_](https://nj-namju.medium.com/clustering-points-collision-based-dynamic-grid-graph-method-f602d0152cd2)
* ~~Korean~~, English
* **keywords:** Mapping, Clustering Data, Visualization, Methodology ...  
* **Research** for clustering point data in digital mapping: This article states a clustering algorithm for dynamic points at different zoom levels on digital mapping. Urban, landscape, or architectural designers could use this methodology to represent data as visual groups or to reveal insights from data while interacting with data directly on the stage of analysis and decision-making process.
